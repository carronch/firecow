    question: "What's the best time to visit the Galapagos?",
    answer: `The Galapagos Islands are a year-round destination! Each season offers unique experiences:
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>December-May (Warm/Wet Season):</strong> Warmer water (75-80°F), calmer seas, best for snorkeling, sea turtle nesting, and marine iguanas breeding.
      <br/>
      <strong>June-November (Cool/Dry Season):</strong> Cooler water (65-75°F), more wildlife activity, great for bird watching, sea lion pupping, and penguin sightings.
      <br/><br/>
      We recommend booking 6-12 months in advance for peak season (June-August and December-January).`
